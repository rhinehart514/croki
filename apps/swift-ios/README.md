# Croki Native

A native SwiftUI client for Croki. The project targets iOS 17 and later on
iPhone and iPad. It has its own bundle identifier and can be installed beside the
React Native Croki app.

The client was imported from T3 Code's experimental SwiftUI PR at commit
`a32dd3a71d8ac0483390398d936c426790c9a140`. Internal `T3Code` target and type
names remain where they make future upstream synchronization safer; visible
identity, storage, deep links, OAuth, App Groups, and bundle IDs are Croki-owned.

## Requirements

- A current Xcode release with an iOS Simulator runtime.
- iOS 17 or later for physical-device builds.
- A Croki pairing URL for direct connections. Croki Connect builds additionally need
  the cloud settings below.

## Open

Open `T3Code.xcodeproj`, choose the `T3Code` scheme, and run an installed iOS
Simulator. Xcode automatically includes files added below `App`, `Core`,
`Features`, `DesignSystem`, and `Resources`; `Info.plist` is the one resource
excluded from copying because it supplies the target's generated Info.plist.

Pair with the same URL produced by a Croki server. The one-time pairing credential is
exchanged for an access token and stored in the Keychain. Environment metadata and
the active selection are stored separately in Application Support.

## Structure

- `App` owns the app lifecycle and the thin root composition seam.
- `Core` owns persistence, credentials, transport, and the Croki protocol.
- `Features` owns onboarding, environments, threads, messages, and settings.
- `DesignSystem` contains the small set of shared visual tokens.
- `Resources` contains the asset catalog.
- `Tests` covers pairing, wire contracts, persistence, and feature state changes.

`RootView` deliberately accepts any SwiftUI content. Production composition injects
`FeatureRootView(client:)` there, keeping protocol adapters out of the UI shell.

## Included

- Local-network preflight, direct pairing links, QR scanning, token exchange,
  Keychain credentials, saved environment management, and optional Croki Connect
  account and relay discovery.
- A merged Web V2 home across saved environments, with per-device reachability,
  collision-safe identities, last-known rows, live active-device updates, and
  low-frequency passive refresh.
- Remote filesystem browsing, source discovery, repository cloning, project
  creation, plus thread search, creation, rename, archive, restore, delete,
  settle, and snooze.
- Provider/model selection, synchronized conversation history, rich Markdown,
  photo/camera/file image attachments, turn cancellation, approval decisions, and
  structured user-input requests.
- Workspace files and previews, working-tree review, Git status and common actions,
  plus an interactive terminal session scoped to each thread.
- Native settings with persisted appearance and behavior preferences, platform
  deep links, shortcuts, background refresh, and notification routing.
- A Share extension that imports text, URLs, and images into persistent project
  drafts, plus Home Screen widgets and aggregate Live Activities for active work.
- DPoP-bound Croki Connect sessions with account-scoped relay credentials, APNs
  device registration on iOS 18+, and automatic credential recovery.

The app speaks the existing HTTP and Effect RPC WebSocket contracts directly. It
does not embed a JavaScript runtime.

## Build configuration

The project expands these user-defined Xcode build settings into its generated
Info.plist:

| Setting                        | Required           | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CROKI_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`  | Croki Connect only | Clerk publishable key.                          |
| `CROKI_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`     | No                 | Relay JWT template; defaults to `croki-relay`.  |
| `CROKI_RELAY_URL`              | Croki Connect only | Relay base URL using HTTPS.                     |
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`             | Device/archive     | Apple Developer team used by automatic signing. |
| `MARKETING_VERSION`            | Release            | User-facing version.                            |
| `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`      | Release            | Monotonically increasing build number.          |

Unset Croki Connect values disable that connection method without affecting direct
pairing. Supply settings on the `xcodebuild` command line or through a local
`.xcconfig`; do not commit private release configuration.

The app and extensions use the fixed `com.croki.croki.native` bundle family and
the `croki-native` URL scheme so they do not collide with another installed
Croki client or an inherited T3 release.

## Verify

Run the `T3Code` scheme's tests in Xcode, or use the same entry point as CI. It
chooses an available iPhone from the newest installed Simulator runtime:

```sh
./Scripts/ci-test.sh
```

Set `T3_SWIFT_SIMULATOR_ID` to pin a specific simulator. CI can invoke this same
entry point without duplicating the simulator-selection or signing policy.

## Install on a physical device

Enable Developer Mode on the device, connect and trust the Mac, then find its
CoreDevice identifier or hardware UDID with
`xcrun devicectl list devices --columns UDID`. The script resolves either form to
the destination UDID expected by Xcode. Xcode must be signed into an Apple
Developer account for the requested team.

```sh
T3_SWIFT_DEVICE_ID="DEVICE-IDENTIFIER" \
T3_SWIFT_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="TEAMID1234" \
./Scripts/install-device.sh
```

The script builds, provisions, installs, and launches the app. It accepts the Croki
Connect build settings above as environment variables. Optional overrides are
`T3_SWIFT_CONFIGURATION`, `T3_SWIFT_DERIVED_DATA_PATH`, `T3_SWIFT_VERSION`, and
`T3_SWIFT_BUILD_NUMBER`. The app and extension bundle identifiers stay fixed so
automatic signing provisions their shared App Group consistently. Run with
`T3_SWIFT_VERIFY_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIERS_ONLY=1` to verify those settings without a
device build.

## Release checklist

1. Set a unique `MARKETING_VERSION` and a higher `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.
2. Confirm the production bundle identifier, display name, app icon, signing team,
   and Croki Connect HTTPS relay configuration.
3. Run `./Scripts/ci-test.sh` and confirm the native test job is green.
4. Smoke-test direct URL and QR pairing, Croki Connect, multi-environment navigation,
   task creation, follow-up messages, attachments, approvals, input requests,
   background/reconnect behavior, and deep links on an iPhone and iPad.
5. Confirm the host, widget, and share-extension identifiers have App Group
   provisioning, and the host has Push Notifications provisioning. Verify APNs
   device registration and Share-extension handoff end to end.
6. Archive the `T3Code` scheme in Release, run Xcode's Validate App and privacy
   report, and confirm `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` is bundled. Re-audit the manifest
   whenever code adds a Required Reason API or data collection.
7. Confirm `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` remains accurate, then distribute
   an internal TestFlight build before App Store submission.
